# BLEPeripheral
After discovering there is no library or convenient solution for turning a Raspberry Pi into a BLE peripheral device, which allows it to connect to a phone via BLE,
I decided to create one myself.
To ensure the time I suffered figuring out how to work with BLE won't be in vain,
I hope someone finds this useful for their project. An explanation of the code will be added soon
